I'm a student who's passionate about technology â€” especially Artificial Intelligence. Right now, I'm learning React, TypeScript, and exploring backend tools like BaaS to build small, meaningful projects.

Still a long way to go, but I'm enjoying the process.  
Just trying to learn something new every day.
